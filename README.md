# My minimal Zsh Configuration

## Setup Instructions

To set up this Zsh configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository into your `.config` directory:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/technophile/zshrc.git ~/.config/zshrc
   ```

2. **Symlink the .zshrc File**

   Create a symbolic link for the `.zshrc` file to your home directory:

   ```shell
   ln -s ~/.config/zshrc/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
   ```

After setting up the symbolic link, restart your terminal or source the `.zshrc` file:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```
